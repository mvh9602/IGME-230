# Joint Jamboree
## I. High Concept
It's Toribash in the style of QWOP!
## II. Genre
Fighting/Simulation
## III. Platform
Desktop only.
## IV. Story
Abstract story. Characters manipulate their joints and muscles to try and take eachother down. The mood will be fun, in a way that highlights the absurdity of the gameplay. The player will want to knock their enemy down before they fall or get knocked down.
## V. Aesthetics
Graphics will be very simple and geometric. Music will be ambient noise. Sound effects will come from making contact and ending the round.
## VI. Gameplay
The player will have a small set of joints they can either extend, contract, rest, or hold. The joints will be a part of a vaguely human character that fits easily into a 2D side perspective. Clicking the joints will change what they will do, or for a second player, keyboard shortcuts to change specific joints. Players will only move in-game after both players select their changes, and then the physics simulation will only persist for about a second beofre the players take their next turn making their moves. There will be an option on the menu to play a tutorial that will teach you the contols while facing you againt a dummy. The player will gain knowlege on the game as they play, as they must keep developing better strategies to beat their opponents.
## VII. Screenshots
This is a mockup of what the combat might look like, featuring the two players mid-battle.

## VIII. About the Developer
I'm Matt Hoffman, game dev major and music technology minor. I'm originally from Cincinnati Ohio and this is my second year at RIT. I have experience in Unity 5, Java, C#, and other languages/programs. The summer before my first year I worked as an intern at a web development company, where I mainly worked in Angular 2 and SQL. I've been playing music since the fifth grade and I look to focus in game music and sound later on in my education. I'm currently teaching myself FL Studio.
